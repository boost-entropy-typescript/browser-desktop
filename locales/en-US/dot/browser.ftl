## The main browser window's title

# These are the default window titles everywhere except macOS. The first two
# attributes are used when the web content opened has no title:
#
# default - "Dot Browser"
# private - "Dot Browser (Private Browsing)"
#
# The last two are for use when there *is* a content title.
# Variables:
#  $content-title (String): the title of the web content.
browser-main-window-window-titles =
    .data-title-default = { -brand-full-name }
    .data-title-private = { -brand-full-name } (Private Browsing)
    .data-content-title-default = { $content-title } — { -brand-full-name }
    .data-content-title-private = { $content-title } — { -brand-full-name } (Private Browsing)

# This gets set as the initial title, and is overridden as soon as we start
# updating the titlebar based on loaded tabs or private browsing state.
# This should match the `data-title-default` attribute in both
# `browser-main-window` and `browser-main-window-mac`.
browser-main-window-title = { -brand-full-name }

# The non-variable portion of this MUST match the translation of
# "PRIVATE_BROWSING_SHORTCUT_TITLE" in custom.properties
